## Executive Summary  

The **SumAction** AI Productivity tool analyzes your uploaded meeting notes (formats supported: text, video, audio) and uses AI to deliver a concise summary of the meetings, key learnings, along with a list of action items and a estimate of the task. The tool allows you to increase your productivity by taking care of the menial tasks of emailing attendees their specific tasks, giving you the opportunity to be more productive or just a rest from the daily rigmarole.

We leveraged OpenAI, its LLMs, and engineered prompts that were effective in creating our productivity tool to summarize uploaded meeting notes (Audio, Video, Text) and to extract action items.

## Project Overview  
We Americans love our meetings! We often find ourselves spending a significant portion of our waking hours in back-to-back meetings. Research indicates that professionals spend an average of 20-25 hours every week in meetings. Furthermore, individuals spend an additional 30-45 minutes on post-meeting activities, including compiling notes, action items, and follow-up tasks. This becomes even more challenging in today's fast-paced work environment, where many of us transition seamlessly from one meeting to the next. The constant context switching and information overload can lead to decreased productivity, increased stress, and a struggle to effectively manage workloads.

Our team is developing an innovative solution that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and intelligent bots to dramatically increase meeting productivity. We aim to address these challenges by creating a suite of tools that automate critical meeting-related tasks, allowing professionals to focus on higher-value activities. 

Our solution offers the following key features:
1. **Automated Summarization:** Our bot automatically generates concise and accurate summaries of meeting discussions, capturing key points and decisions. This eliminates the need for manual note-taking and ensures that all participants have a clear record of what was discussed.

1. **Action Item Tracking and Assignment:** The bot intelligently identifies and extracts action items from meeting conversations, automatically assigning them to responsible parties. This ensures clear accountability and prevents action items from falling through the cracks.

1. **Automated Distribution:** Summarized notes and assigned action items are automatically distributed via email to relevant participants, streamlining communication and ensuring that everyone stays informed.

1. **Action Item Effort Estimation: (Key Differentiator)** Unlike existing solutions, our bot goes beyond simple action item tracking. It leverages LLMs to provide effort estimates for assigned action items. This unique feature enables users to:

    1. ***Improve Project Planning:*** Accurately estimate the time required for each task, facilitating more effective project planning and resource allocation.

    1. ***Optimize Scheduling:*** Better manage individual workloads and schedules by understanding the effort involved in completing assigned tasks.

    1. ***Proactively Manage Delays:*** Identify potential bottlenecks or scheduling conflicts early on, allowing for proactive mitigation and ensuring timely deliverable completion.

1. **Aggregated Action Item Management: (Key Differentiator)** Our solution also gathers and consolidates all action items assigned to individual users across all their meetings within a given day. This provides a comprehensive overview of daily responsibilities, enabling users to:

    1. ***Prioritize Tasks Effectively:*** Gain a holistic view of their workload, allowing them to prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance.

    1. ***Optimize Daily Workflow:*** Plan their workday more efficiently by understanding the full scope of their commitments.

    1. ***Enhance Time Management:*** Proactively manage their time and avoid feeling overwhelmed by fragmented action items spread across multiple meetings.

1. **Contextual Query Bot:** We have also developed a query bot that allows users to quickly retrieve specific information from past meetings. This bot enhances recall and facilitates efficient context gathering, enabling users to:

    1. ***Quickly Find Information:*** Avoid spending valuable time searching through lengthy meeting transcripts or notes.

    1. ***Improve Decision Making:*** Access relevant historical information to make more informed decisions.

    1. ***Onboard New Team Members:*** Quickly bring new team members up to speed by providing them with easy access to past meeting discussions.


By automating these time-consuming and often tedious tasks, our AI-powered meeting bot empowers professionals to reclaim valuable time, reduce stress, and focus on the substantive aspects of their work.

## Data Collection 
- (Also See [Data Sources](#data-sources))  
1. Public Meetings:  
    - Initial assessment conducted to understand the data and identify any issues
        - Read in meetings from the dataset that included full notes and summaries
      
2. Zain's Meeting Notes:
    - Actual meeting notes (NOT Included in the resources as they were only used for testing the evaluator: Bleu, ROUGE, Tokens)
    - Additional formatted examples were also include to test the solutions transcribe capabilities (video/ audio > text)
    - Multiple Meeting notes that were hand written by a human for summarizer evaluation


## Data Analysis
- GOAL: Have the bot properly transcribe meeting notes, create a summary *(high accuracy, precision and recall)*, extract action items, assign a task estimate to them, and lastly send the summary and action items out to relevant users. 


## Visualizations

## Summarizer Evaluation: 
We wanted to ensure that SumActionâ€™s summarizer was up to the task. While the prompts get all the spotlight, as we know the outputs are generated based on the level of detail and clarity provided, we wanted to evaluate how good our summary was. Measuring the performance of text generation tasks like summarization or translation is not as straightforward. Applying some sort of exact match between the generated summary and the label is not a good solution â€” even humans would fare poorly under such a metric, because we all have our own writing style. One of the most commonly used metrics for summarization is the **ROUGE score** *(short for Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)* or **BLEU** *(bilingual evaluation understudy)*.

- ***Bleu measures precision:*** how much the words (and/or n-grams) in the machine generated summaries appeared in the human reference summaries. 
- ***Rouge measures recall:*** how much the words (and/or n-grams) in the human reference summaries appeared in the machine generated summaries.

The methods essentially compare a generated summary against a set of reference summaries that are typically created by humans. 

***Tokens:*** We also looked at the Token Count / Compression ratios as they reveal how efficiently a summarization model reduces the original text while preserving its meaning. Token count indicates the number of word fragments (tokens) in a piece of text, while compression ratio measures the reduction in token count between the original text and its summary. 

Long story short, SumAction is doing a good enough job to summarize meeting notes and call out learnings. NOTE: We also compared how our models output compared to that of another models output and can see a lot more similarity in recall and precision scoring â€¦ which kinda points to that the models are converging closer to each other Or despite being named differently, they had a similar training set

## Lessons Learned
Obtaining Data that is accurate and reliable early on is important.  Authoratative public data can hold interesting patterns.  Data can have irregularities and data needs to be normalized.  Different types of statistical analyses, graphing and plotting reveal interesting patterns within the data.  Processing data files takes time and diligence to normalize as there are time zone, UTC and formatting issues to overcome.  Communicatiing roles and responsibilities with expected deliverable dates will help on future projects to best utilize resources.  Version control and using github can be a challenge; the .DSstore file from the Apple IOS proved to be problematic and 'dot ignore' file is mandatory at this level of programming.  

**Cost Of Project**
Using the following average Colorado salary scales for team member roles, we were able to calculate the cost of conducting this project. 
- Data Scientist (1): $104,771 | *(per week cost = $2014.82)*
- Data Engineer (2): $117,223 | *(per week cost = $2254.29)*
- Project Manager (1): $93,823 | *(per week cost = $1804.29)* 

Total Internal Cost for Conducting Analysis (2 weeks) = $16,655.38 

Having proven that there isn't a relationship that exists between Full Moons and Erratic Beahvior *(Crime/Traffic Violations)*, we hope to reach out to the **6000** 911 call centers, also known as Public Safety Answering Points [PSAs](https://health.wusf.usf.edu/health-news-florida/2024-07-18/the-nations-911-system-is-on-the-brink-of-its-own-emergency) that may be prone to overstaffing their call centers with additional resources to handle a percieved increase in erratic behavior, especially surrounding full moon days *(3 days: 1 day prior, day of full moon, 1 day after)* that are still percieved by many to be a full moon. 

**Tax Payer Savings**
Assume we save the need to overstaff just by a single dispatcher across the 3 days of percieved full moons *(3 days: 1 day prior, day of full moon, 1 day after)*  
- Average call center dispatcher makes [$18/hour](https://www.ziprecruiter.com/Salaries/Customer-Service-Dispatcher-Salary). 
    - We'd save tax payers around *~$486/person* for a single dispatcher working over the 3 days they plan to overstaff to handle the alledge additional call volume. 
- There are roughly **6000** [911 call Centers](https://health.wusf.usf.edu/health-news-florida/2024-07-18/the-nations-911-system-is-on-the-brink-of-its-own-emergency) in the US.
- 36 Alleged Full Moon days (12 actual Full Moons in a year. +/- 1 day surrounding the full moon)
- Savings of even 1 staff member across 36 Full Moon Days in a Year across 6000 PSAs could save the tax payers =  *$34,992,000*     *(12 x $486 x 6000 locations)*
  

## Next Steps:
If a organization, public or private, are willing to sponsor and provide authoratative raw data on local crime, traffic, 911, Emergency rooms and other first responder data, the Lunar Madness Team ("LM") could be contracted to combine the data and further refine this proof of concept template.  The LM framework includes moon phase data, and has several models to plug in local and regional data to uncover statistical correlations.  The Lunar Madness team will scour the data for high correlation events such as crime with other local events or phenomena, research is not limited to just moon phase data.  Set our team to the task of investigating revenue patterns, custom projects, or explore for unidentified trends.  Correlated information that leads to efficient management and can be predicted can make the difference between success vs. surviving.  Let us know the problem you wish to solve and we will do the analysys and presentation for you and your organization.
